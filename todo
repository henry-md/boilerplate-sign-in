bugs
- I have to setTimer after login so cookies can be read in time — seems buggy
- cookies is not being set properly in navbar after sign in, so you're signed in but it still gives "login" and "signup" options.

not to forget later
- I changed password to passwordHash
- I changed login to sign-in


things I did since last meeting
- migrated file from js -> ts
- migrated from bad practice token/session mixed auth to session based auth with Lucia
